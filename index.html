        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first generation female Burmese-Rohingya American that will be graduating in the Winter of March 2023. I will be earning a Bachelors of Science in Medical Anthropology which then I will hopefully be applying to Physician Assistant programs. My medical journey started off when I volunteered at the Saddleback Memorial Center at the age of 17. I was incharge of making sure the patients were fed and were somewhat comfortable with their stay while recovering. This experience lasted for about three years which then made me curious about the depth of the medical field. I then went to Italy to shadow doctors for about three weeks.  The program's mission was to cultivate health-science students, the future leaders, by exposing them to physicians' daily decisions to save lives. However, the three weeks spent taught me that the medical field isn't very rosy. You often have to do things out of your comfort zone while at your maximum. <br><br>

        The opportunity I received empowered me to step out of my comfort zone and enroll myself in a Certified Nursing Assistant program. I completed an accelerated CNA program then started working during the beginning of the pandemic. Working during a pandemic was simultaneously a nightmare and an eye-opening experience. As a nursing assistant, I have seen one too many deaths, cries for help, and regret in welled up eyes, all within a short span of six months. I grasped the hands of patients, who all have a special place in my heart, as I watched them take their last breath. The weight of the responsibility only became heavier as I made the calls to patients' loved ones. I've experienced this rollercoaster ride many times before, I even learned to cope with it, but it doesn't get easier. Like any frontline worker, I put on personal protective equipment. Before each shift, I  acknowledge that I'm putting my life and the lives of the people I love the most. I held that thought in my head while trying to put a smile on my face because I'm one of the few people our patients get to interact with since the lockdown. <br><br>

        After the experience, I decided I wanted to major in something that would give me a holistic approach to the medical field and towards life in general. That is where I found 
Anthropology;  a multidisciplinary field that aims to understand the impact of a surrounding environment on an individual. It requires me to continually question my cultural assumptions and medical practices as I am going to interact with other human beings. 
Growing up, I always felt like an outsider in the various communities that I lived in.  It would be rare for someone to understand what it meant for me to be Burmese and Rohingya. I often felt hostility for not being fully one over the other. These circumstances forced me to build meaningful relationships with those from different cultures than mine. I ate lumpia with my Filipino friends and sang Fairuz with my Arab friends. The novelty of discovery drove my fascination with exploring various cultures. I began to think deeper about the systems at play behind these subtle yet beautiful differences amongst people. It wasn’t until I discovered anthropology that I had access to the language to describe phenomena like ethnocentrism, which had a tangible impact on my upbringing. It is the ideal medium to help me understand my lived experience. My readiness to study upper-division Anthropology boils down to combining my lived experience and enthusiasm for the subject. I hope to continue my studies and broaden my knowledge by researching the development of traditions and practices and their effect on human behavior.
